The Pathfinder2eCharacterImport takes a JSON data structure from Pathbuilder2e output, 
and puts the values in the appropriate fields.

Once the Json data structure is placed in the character sheets campaign notes,
in the chat type "!importPF2" witout double quotes (").

Outstanding issues:
1) Upon programmatically adding languages, weapons, armors, feats, spells (anything with a dynamic row addition) - unable to find the setting to close the expansion (may need to do this manually from the player side ... possibly add a note to check the data entry?)
2) PF2 CharacterSheet by roll20 Class DC select box uses stat modifier as the unique value - may not be set correctly if the character has 2 modifiers of the same value
3) hit_points_max is calculated for players (and not set), NPC has hit_points_max set ... no way to get hit_points_max into the current hit points (calculate and hope the numbers add up?)
4) Not all the fields auto-populate (should these be forced)?
5) 
Future plans -
parsing creature blocks to the npc elements
HeroLab conversion
